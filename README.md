## Introduction
This project will be about a dataset or webscrapping data about worldwide book sales. I'll work on cleaning the dataset, analysing the data and finally
making a visualization of all the collected data or grouped data

Information I'd like to find :

- I'd like to see who was the best author;
- Make a top 10 of certain elements ( Author, Publisher, Book, Gross sales , ect )
- I'd like to make certain comparison and analysing certain information about the publisher, the average ratings and average revenue
- The reason why certain book sold more and find certain outliers and exempt them from the datasets.

- Obviously it's a 2 days long project and I'm fairly new in the data analysing world so I went at it with the few tools I had in hands
- and used this Project to learn and get used to using it on my own.

- I'd like to thanks Josh Murray for this dataset and if you guys want it it's available on this link below:
